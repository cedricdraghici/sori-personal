# AI Multi-Language Translator

🚀 **Inspiration**

Before tools like this existed, if we didn’t understand a word or sentence we would reach for physical monolingual or bilingual dictionaries. As technology evolved, we moved on to copying and pasting text into Google Translate or LLMs but always in a separate tab or separate page. Both approaches break the flow of reading and make the experience feel disconnected.

On top of that, traditional translation tools are often inaccurate or too literal. They don’t understand the context surrounding a word, which leads to awkward or incorrect translations. This extension solves that by using the OpenAI API to deliver context-aware, highly accurate translations that take into account surrounding words, tone, and meaning right on the page without interrupting your reading.
